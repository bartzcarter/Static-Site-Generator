# Static Site Generator (SSG)

## Overview

A **Static Site Generator (SSG)** is a tool that takes content, written in Markdown, and converts it into a static HTML site. Unlike traditional dynamic websites, a static site consists of fixed HTML pages, which makes it faster and easier to host. Our Static Site Generator automates this process, allowing you to generate beautiful, static websites with ease.

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Static Site Generator using Python. It converts Markdown files into an HTML website with templating and styling.

## Features

- **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: The core functionality is the conversion of Markdown content into HTML.
- **Template Rendering**: The HTML output is dynamically inserted into a pre-designed template.
- **Simple Web Server**: Once the site is generated, a simple web server is started for previewing the site locally.
